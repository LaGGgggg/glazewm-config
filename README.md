My config for the [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)

Changes from the default [sample-config](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm/blob/main/resources/assets/sample-config.yaml):
- Visual
  - Removed window gaps
  - Reduced top window gap (60px -> 30px)
  - Changed workspaces display names
  - A lot of keybindings changes (note that I'm actively using the `F17` button)
- Feautres
  - Keybindings for moving focused window to a workspace without focusing on it
